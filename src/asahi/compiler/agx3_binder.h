 * Most AGX3 forms carry a fixed set of selector/context field values plus a
 * handful of operand fields. A binder starts from a per-form baseline (the
 * constants, recovered by decoding a witnessed instruction), overrides the
 * operand fields with the caller's values, and asks the composer to encode. The
 * composer fails closed on any contradiction, so a wrong override cannot
 * silently produce a valid-looking instruction.
