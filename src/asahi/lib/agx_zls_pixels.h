/*
 * The depth/stencil pixel dimensions the ISP is told about. AGX2 packs them
 * through CR_ISP_ZLS_PIXELS, but the AGX3 generations do not agree: G17P
 * keeps the 15-bit pair (a native 256x256 render publishes 0x007f80ff) while
 * G17G widens the second field to 16 bits (the same render publishes
 * 0x00ff00ff), and so does G18G (the J873 256x256 depth and stencil renders
 * publish 0x00ff00ff). All treat zero as the inactive encoding rather than a
 * minus-one 1x1 surface, so a render with no depth or stencil storage
 * publishes zero on each. Honeykrisp's hk_drm_*_zls_pixels() are the
 * witnesses for these three rules; this is the same packing where Gallium
 * and the Vulkan driver can share it.
