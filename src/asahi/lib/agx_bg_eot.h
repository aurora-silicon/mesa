 * builtin factory sorts every attachment key into one of five imageblock
 * format classes, and all five have been generated for applegpu_g17g from the
 * same architecture-independent request that produced the G17P tables, so the
 * admitted set is the physical formats whose store shape those classes cover.
 *
 * SRGBA8 is admitted because the end-of-tile builder stores sRGB tiles through
 * the same U8NORM text: the fragment shader already applied the transfer and
 * the PBE descriptor, not the shader, carries the memory format. RG11B10F is
 * not, because G17G keeps the packed-float tile in its own physical format
 * rather than the raw 32-bit word G17P rewrites it to, and that shape has no
 * witness. RGB9E5 is left out for the same reason.
 *
 * A format admitted here can still be refused later: the compiler matches the
 * whole post-register-allocation graph, and anything it does not recognize
 * fails the shader rather than emitting a partially grounded store.
