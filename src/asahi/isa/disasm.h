/*
 * One decoder per instruction encoding. AGX2 covers G13/G14 (M1/M2). AGX3 is a
 * different instruction set with three encodings, established by decoding a
 * 274-kernel corpus with each of the AGX3 instruction encoding tables:
 *
 *   agx3b -- G15 (M3), G16 (M4) and G17P, all dies.
 *   agx3c -- G17 (M5), all dies.
 *   agx3d -- G18G (M6), transcribed from the third variant of the same
 *            tables. Every instruction of the 41 G18G witness programs
 *            in src/asahi/compiler/test/native/g18g decodes to a known form
 *            under it and each program ends in `end`; under agx3c the same
 *            programs hit 128 unknown opcodes.
 *
 * The AGX3 tables share no decode logic; a stream from one decodes as
 * valid-looking but wrong instructions under another, so pick by chip via
 * agx_chip_isa_encoding() rather than by trying each.
