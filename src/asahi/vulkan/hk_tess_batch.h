/*
 * Software tessellation runs five compute stages before the render, each
 * reading what the previous one wrote (hk_launch_tess()). Recorded draw by
 * draw, every stage needs a cache flush: a pass of a few hundred terrain
 * patches becomes thousands of serialized tiny dispatches. The draws of one
 * render do not read each other's tessellation state, so their stages can
 * run side by side: each stage is recorded into its own side stream, and
 * hk_tess_batch_flush() splices the streams into the pre-graphics stream
 * with one flush after each stage.
 *
 * Within a side stream, consecutive launches carry no barrier at all, as
 * consecutive application dispatches on G15 (hk_dispatch_g17p_native()).
 * Even the weak ordering barrier that ends every native launch waits for the
 * launch before it: with it, a pass of 1024 draws (vulkan-tess-batch) takes
 * 27 ms on the M4 Pro whether or not the stages also flush; without it, 1 ms.
 * This needs two things. The launches of one stage are independent: each
 * reads only what the previous stage of its own draw wrote, and tessellator
 * heap allocations are atomic. And the cache flush after a stage waits for
 * all of its launches, not just the last one, before the next stage starts,
 * as G15's barrier-less application dispatches assume
 * (agx_chip_elide_app_dispatch_barrier()); vulkan-tess-batch-order is the
 * hardware test for it. The G17P stream validator accepts direct launches
 * back to back and still wants a barrier before anything else.
 *
 * Any other work for the pre-graphics stream flushes the batch first
 * (hk_cmd_buffer_get_cs_general()), as does the end of the render, so that
 * work keeps its place after the tessellation of the draws before it.
